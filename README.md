# speedtest_analysis
This program will 🚀 check your Speedtest results, and transform them into a line graph 📈.

Just the other day, I was wondering 🤔 about the Internet speed. There are some days when I'm glued to my phone 📱, using cellular data, just to binge on YouTube videos 📺.

I vividly remember a Speedtest 🌐 I ran back in May 2023, where the download speed 📥 was humming around 250 Mbps, and the upload speed 📤 was around 50 Mbps. It was smooth sailing ⛵, even though our Xfinity promises to blaze 🚀 at 400 Mbps at its peak 🏔️.

This project conducts a speedtest every 6 hours 🕕 --> 4 times a day ☀️🌙.

After compiling the data 📊, it releases weekly bar graphs 📊 in png format 🖼️.

The data on outcomes will be provided soon 📩...
